Our Connectors program is part of this approach. Designed in a bottom-up approach, it contributes to consolidate the network approach at the heart of Digital Africa's vision, through its objective: to support, federate and strengthen this ecosystem, to move forward together. Already a strong and dynamic community, with effective partnerships with incubators, hubs, institutional financiers, venture capitalists, tech clusters, training organizations, universities, etc., Digital Africa is thus accentuating its local footprint to better understand the needs, design more effective programs and thus reach a maximum number of beneficiaries and partners on the continent.

By playing a bridging role between Africa and the rest of the world with enthusiasm and conviction, we help to draw attention to African solutions and to connect Africa to global value chains.
